Project Overview
Goal: Create a system where voters register, cast votes anonymously, and results are tallied transparently on a blockchain.
Key Features:
Voter registration with unique IDs.
Vote casting (e.g., for candidates).
Immutable vote storage on blockchain.
Result querying.
Tech Stack:
Blockchain: Ethereum (testnet via Ganache).
Smart Contract: Solidity (deployed via Python).
Python Libraries: web3.py (for blockchain interaction), cryptography (for hashing voter IDs).
Tools: Ganache (local Ethereum simulator), MetaMask (for wallet simulation, optional).
